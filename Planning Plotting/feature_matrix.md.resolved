- **KPI 3 & 4 (Meetings):** Automated scoring based on skip status (-1 Informed, -2/-6 Uninformed).
- **KPI 5 (Peer Review):** Automated averaging of received peer ratings.
- **KPI 6 (Deadlines):** Automated day-based penalty (0.5 per day late) unless waived by Admin.
- **KPI 7 (Weekly Reports):** Penalties for late (-3) or missed (-6) submissions.
