## 📅 Today's Executive Summary

We have reached a major milestone today: the **Universal Shell**. The application now behaves like a professional platform, automatically adapting its interface whether viewed from a PC or a smartphone. We also launched the **Attendance Heartbeat**, a real-time system that monitors employee presence down to the second.

### 🏆 Key Achievements

- **Universal Layout Implementation:** Successfully deployed a hybrid UI (Sidebar for Web / Bottom-Nav for Mobile) that ensures 100% feature access on all devices.
- **Real-time Attendance Console:** Developed a stateful UI component featuring a 1-second live clock pulse and automated "Late" validation logic.
- **Deployment Pipeline Hub:** Established a live Vercel link, allowing the boss to review progress in real-time on their own device.
- **Git & CI/CD workflow:** Initialized semantic version control for professional-grade project tracking.

## 🚀 Plan for Tomorrow (The "Heavy-Duty" Shift)

2. **User Authentication Gate:** Building the login logic to differentiate Admin and Employee access.
3. **KPI Points Logic:** Enabling the automated scoring math (deductions for being past 9:00 AM).
